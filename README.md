# Hello-from-the-other-side
**My first foray into the amazing world of Git!**

As part of the requirements of the course PSYCH 251 (*and also because I've had a really productive day*), I would like to use Git to tell a story!

If you would like to hear it, please indicate.

-[x] Yes
-[] No

So I'm assuming y'all went with Yes right? Who wouldn't want to hear a good story!

It all began one evening in January when I woke up with a start. After a rather demanding day, I had nodded off at my Windows laptop and my forehead had just connected with the Start key.
